/**
 * This selector is supposed to match just the field values
 * we interpolate inside each template, so they are treated
 * as inline blocks. Example:
 *
 * Template:
 *
 *   What is the meaning of @Question?
 *
 * Question value:
 *
 *   life
 *
 * Without this rule, the `@Question` would be a `display: block`
 * (because the Draft Editor root is a `div`), and would be displayed
 * in the flashcard like:
 *
 * FlashCard:
 *
 *   What is the meaning of
 *   life
 *   ?
 *
 * And the desired result should be the same as the template
 *
 * FlashCard:
 *
 *   What is the meaning of life?
